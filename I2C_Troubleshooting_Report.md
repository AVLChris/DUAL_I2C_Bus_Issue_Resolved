# Resolving I2C Bus Delays and Conflicts on ESP32

## Issue Summary
When setting up an ESP32 to interface with two separate I2C devices on different buses (`Wire` for I2C1 and `Wire1` for I2C2), significant delays and timeouts occurred during I2C bus scans. The devices were either not detected, or the scan on `Wire1` (I2C2) was excessively slow. These delays persisted despite confirming proper wiring, voltage levels, and pull-up resistors.

---

## Root Causes
1. **Improper initialization of `Wire` and `Wire1`:** 
   - The ESP32 requires explicit initialization of both I2C buses using the `begin()` method, specifying the correct pins for each bus. Without this step, one or both buses can exhibit undefined behavior.
2. **Faulty or insufficiently soldered I2C address selection resistors:** 
   - A poorly soldered connection on the OLED module caused address conflicts and unreliable communication.
3. **Conflicting or unverified pin configurations:**
   - Incorrect SDA/SCL pin assignments in code could lead to scanning failures or slow performance.

---

## Solution

### 1. Verify Hardware Connections
- **Power Supply:**
  - Ensure each I2C device and the ESP32 are supplied with the correct voltage (3.3V for the ESP32 and OLEDs).
  - Confirm that all devices share a **common ground**.
- **Pull-Up Resistors:**
  - Use 4.7kâ„¦ pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL lines for both I2C buses. Measure and confirm the voltage is approximately 3.3V on these lines.
- **OLED Modules:**
  - Check and fix solder joints on address selection resistors to ensure the proper I2C addresses (`0x3C` and `0x3D`) are configured.

### 2. Configure Pins and Initialize I2C Buses
- Assign unique SDA and SCL pins for each I2C bus. In this case:
  - **I2C1 (`Wire`):** `SDA = 21`, `SCL = 22`
  - **I2C2 (`Wire1`):** `SDA = 25`, `SCL = 26`
- Initialize both buses explicitly in the `setup()` function:
  ```cpp
  Wire.begin(21, 22);  // Initialize I2C1 with correct pins
  Wire1.begin(25, 26); // Initialize I2C2 with correct pins
  ```

### 3. Implement Correct I2C Scanning Code
- Use dedicated functions to scan each bus independently and ensure proper detection of devices. Below is a tested and working example:
  ```cpp
  #include <Wire.h>

  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    delay(2000);

    // Initialize I2C buses
    Wire.begin(21, 22);  // SDA, SCL for I2C1
    Wire1.begin(25, 26); // SDA, SCL for I2C2

    // Scan each bus
    Serial.println("---------- Scanning Wire (I2C1) -------------");
    scanI2C(Wire);
    Serial.println("---------- Scanning Wire1 (I2C2) ------------");
    scanI2C(Wire1);
  }

  void loop() {}

  void scanI2C(TwoWire &wire) {
    byte error, address;
    int nDevices = 0;

    Serial.println("Scanning...");
    for (address = 1; address < 127; address++) {
      wire.beginTransmission(address);
      error = wire.endTransmission();

      if (error == 0) {
        Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
        if (address < 16)
          Serial.print("0");
        Serial.print(address, HEX);
        Serial.println("  !");
        nDevices++;
      } else if (error == 4) {
        Serial.print("Unknown error at address 0x");
        if (address < 16)
          Serial.print("0");
        Serial.println(address, HEX);
      }
    }

    if (nDevices == 0)
      Serial.println("No I2C devices found
");
    else
      Serial.println("done
");
  }
  ```

### 4. Test Without Devices
- To rule out hardware issues, test I2C buses without devices connected. Both buses should scan with no delay or timeouts, indicating proper software configuration.

### 5. Resolve Device-Specific Issues
- Reconnect I2C devices one at a time and repeat the scan. Verify that:
  - Each device is detected at the expected address.
  - There are no delays or communication failures.

## Key Learnings
1. **Always initialize I2C buses explicitly:** ESP32 requires both SDA and SCL pins to be defined during initialization of `Wire` and `Wire1`.
2. **Verify hardware thoroughly:** Issues such as poor soldering or incorrect pull-up resistor values can cause intermittent communication failures.
3. **Use systematic testing:** Isolate hardware and software components to pinpoint the root cause of issues.

---

## Future Recommendations
- **Document Pin Configurations:** Clearly label and document SDA/SCL pin assignments for each I2C bus in code and physical diagrams.
- **Use Debugging Tools:** Utilize a logic analyzer or oscilloscope to monitor I2C signals when diagnosing complex issues.
- **Maintain Clean Connections:** Double-check solder joints, wires, and pull-up resistors to prevent intermittent failures.

This process successfully resolved the issue, and the I2C buses now function reliably.
